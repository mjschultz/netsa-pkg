/*
 *    The circBuf_t hands cells to the writer which the writer fills.
 *    The circBuf_t holds onto these cells until the reader requests
 *    them.  The maxinum number of cells a circBuf_t may allocate is
 *    specified at creatation time.  However, the cells are not
 *    allocated as one block of memory.  Instead, the circBuf_t
 *    allocates smaller blocks of memory called chunks.  All chunks
 *    are the same size.  To summarize, the circBuf_t is composed of
 *    multiple chunks, and a chunk is composed of multiple cells.
 *
 *    For each chunk, the 'head' points to the cell currently in use
 *    by the writer, and the 'tail' points to the cell currently in
 *    use by the reader.
 *
 *    All cells "between" the tail and the head have data.  In the
 *    diagram below, the writer (head) has wrapped around, and all
 *    cells with 'D' have data.  'W' is where the writer is currently
 *    writing data, and 'R' is where the reader is reading.
 *        _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 *       |D|D|W|_|_|_|_|_|R|D|D|D|
 *            A A         A A
 *            | |         | |
 *            | next_head | next_tail
 *            |           |
 *            head        tail
 *
 *    When the writer or reader finishes with a cell, they call the
 *    appropriate function which releases the current cell and moves
 *    them to the next cell.
 *
 *    If a chunk becomes full, a new chunk is allocated and the writer
 *    starts using cells from the new chunk.  Depending on the chunk
 *    size and maximum number of cells allowed, there may be multiple
 *    chunks in the chunk list between the writer and the reader.
 *
 *    Once the reader finishes with all the cells in the current
 *    chunk, the reader moves to the first cell of the next chunk in
 *    the chunk list, and the chunk the reader just completed is
 *    discarded.  The circBuf_t is circular within a chunk, but linear
 *    between multiple chunks.
 *
 *    The first time the circBuf_t has a chunk to discard, the
 *    circBuf_t stores the chunk as spare (instead of deallocating the
 *    chunk).  When a chunk needs to be discard and the circBuf_t
 *    already has a spare chunk, the chunk is deallocated.
