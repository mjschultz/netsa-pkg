/*
 *  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 *
 *  Each probe is represented by a single skIPFIXSource_t object.
 *
 *  For probes that process file-based IPFIX sources, the
 *  skIPFIXSource_t object contains an fBuf_t object.  When the caller
 *  invokes skIPFIXSourceGetGeneric(), the next record is read from
 *  the fBuf_t and the record is returned.  For consistency with
 *  network processing (described next), the file-based
 *  skIPFIXSource_t has an skIPFIXSourceBase_t object, but that object
 *  does little for file-based sources.
 *
 *  For probes that process network-based IPFIX sources, the
 *  combination of the following four values must be unique: protocol,
 *  listen-on-port, listen-as-address, accept-from-host.  (Note that
 *  an ADDR_ANY value for listen-as-address or accept-from-host
 *  matches all other addresses.)
 *
 *  Each skIPFIXSource_t references an skIPFIXSourceBase_t object.
 *  Each unique listen-as-address/listen-to-port/protocol triple is
 *  handled by a single fbListener_t object, which is contained in the
 *  skIPFIXSourceBase_t object.  When two skIPFIXSource_t's differ
 *  only by their accept-from-host addreses, the skIPFIXSource_t's
 *  reference the same skIPFIXSourceBase_t object.  The
 *  skIPFIXSourceBase_t objects contain a reference-count.  The
 *  skIPFIXSourceBase_t is destroyed when the last skIPFIXSource_t
 *  referring to it is destroyed.
 *
 *  An skIPFIXConnection_t represents a connection, which is one of
 *  two things: In the TCP case, a connection is equivalent to a TCP
 *  connection.  In the UDP case, a connection is a given set of IPFIX
 *  or NFv9 UDP packets sent from a given address, to a given address,
 *  on a given port, with a given domain ID.  The skIPFIXConnection_t
 *  object is ipfixsource's way of mapping to the fbSession_t object
 *  in libfixbuf.
 *
 *  There can be multiple active connections on a probe---consider a
 *  probe that collects from two machines that load-balance.  In the
 *  code, this is represented by having each skIPFIXConnection_t
 *  object point to its skIPFIXSource_t.  As described below, the
 *  skIPFIXConnection_t is stored as the context pointer on the
 *  libfixbuf fbCollector_t object.
 *
 *  When a new TCP connection arrives or if a new UDP connection is
 *  seen and we are using a fixbuf that supports multi-UDP, the
 *  fixbufConnect() callback function first determines whether the
 *  peer is allowed to connect.  If the peer is allowed, the function
 *  sets the context pointer for the fbCollector_t object to the a new
 *  skIPFIXConnection_t object which contains statistics information
 *  for the connection and the skIPFIXSource_t object associated with
 *  the connection.  These skIPFIXConnection_t objects are destroyed
 *  in the fixbufDisconnect() callback.
 *
 *  When a new UDP peer sends data to the listener, the actual address
 *  is not known until the underlying recvmesg() call itself, rather
 *  than in an accept()-like call similar to TCP.  What this means is
 *  that in this scenario the fixbufConnect() appInit function is not
 *  called until a call to fBufNext() or fBufNextCollectionTemplate()
 *  is called.
 *
 *  There is a similar fixbufConnectUDP() function to handle UDP
 *  connections when libfixbuf does not support multi-UDP.  However,
 *  the fundamental difference is this: TCP connections are associated
 *  with a new fbCollector_t at connection time.  Non-multi-UDP
 *  connections are associated with a new fbCollector_t during the
 *  fbListenerAlloc() call.
 *
 *  FIXBUF API ISSUE: The source objects connected to the
 *  fbCollector_t objects have to be passed to the
 *  fixbufConnect*() calls via global objects---newly created
 *  sources are put into a red-black tree; the call to
 *  fixbufConnect*() attempts to find the value in the red-black tree.
 *  It would have made more sense if fbListenerAlloc() took a
 *  caller-specified context pointer which would get passed to the
 *  fbListenerAppInit_fn() and fbListenerAppFree_fn() functions.
 *
 *  There is one ipfix_reader() thread per skIPFIXSourceBase_t object.
 *  This thread loops around fbListenerWait() returning fBuf_t
 *  objects.  The underlying skIPFIXConnection_t containing the source
 *  information is grabbed from the fBuf_t's collector.  The
 *  fBufNext() is used to read the data from the fBuf_t and this data
 *  is associated with the given source by either inserting it into
 *  the source's circular buffer, or by adding the stats information
 *  to the source.  Then we loop back determining any new connection
 *  and dealing with the next piece of data until the fBuf_t empties.
 *  We then return to fbListenerWait() to get the next fBuf_t.

 *  Since there is one thread per listener, if one source attached to
 *  a listener blocks due to the circular buffer becoming full, all
 *  sources attached to the listener will block as well.  Solving this
 *  problem would involve more threads, and moving away from the
 *  fbListenerWait() method of doing things.  We could instead have a
 *  separate thread per connection.  This would require us to handle
 *  the connections (bind/listen/accept) ourselves, and then create
 *  fBufs from the resulting file descriptors.
