=head1 NAME

B<SiLK> - the System for Internet-Level Knowledge

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SiLK is a collection of traffic analysis tools developed by the CERT
Network Situational Awareness Team (CERT NetSA) to facilitate security
analysis of large networks.  The SiLK tool suite supports the
efficient collection, storage, and analysis of network flow data,
enabling network security analysts to rapidly query large historical
traffic data sets.  SiLK is ideally suited for analyzing traffic on
the backbone or border of a large, distributed enterprise or mid-sized
ISP.

A SiLK installation consists of two categories of applications: the
analysis suite and the packing system.

=head2 Analysis suite

The SiLK analysis suite is a collection of command-line tools for
processing SiLK Flow records created by the SiLK packing system.
These tools read binary files containing SiLK Flow records and
partition, sort, and count these records.  The most important analysis
tool is B<rwfilter(1)>, an application for querying the central data
repository for SiLK Flow records that satisfy a set of filtering
options.  The tools are intended to be combined in various ways to
perform an analysis task.  A typical analysis uses UNIX pipes and
intermediate data files to share data between invocations of tools.

The tools, configuration files, and plug-in modules that make up the
analysis tools are listed below, roughly grouped by functionality.

I<Filtering, sorting, and display>

B<rwfilter(1)> partitions SiLK Flow records into one or more 'pass'
and/or 'fail' output streams.  B<rwfilter> is the primary tool for
pulling flows from the data store.

B<silk.conf(5)> is the configuration file naming the Classes, Types,
and Sensors available at your installation.

B<rwsort(1)> sorts SiLK Flow records using a user-specified key
comprised of record attributes, and writes the records to the named
output path or to the standard output.  Users can define new key
fields using plug-ins written in C or PySiLK.

B<rwcut(1)> prints the attributes of SiLK Flow records in a delimited,
columnar, human-readable format.  Users can define new printable
attributes using plug-ins written in C or PySiLK.

I<SiLK Python Extension>

B<pysilk(3)>. PySiLK, the SiLK Python extension, allows one to read,
manipulate, and write SiLK Flow records, IPsets, and Bags from within
Python.  PySiLK may be used in a stand-alone Python program or to
write plug-ins for several SiLK applications.  This document describes
the objects, methods, and functions that PySiLK provides.  The next
entry describes using PySiLK from within a plug-in.

B<silkpython(3)>.  The SiLK Python plug-in provides a way to use
PySiLK to define new partitioning rules for B<rwfilter(1)>, new key
fields for B<rwcut(1)>, B<rwgroup(1)>, and B<rwsort(1)>, and new key
or value fields for B<rwstats(1)> and B<rwuniq(1)>.

I<Counting and statistics>

B<rwuniq(1)> bins (groups) SiLK Flow records by a user-specified key
comprised of record attributes and prints the total byte, packet,
and/or flow counts for each bin.  B<rwuniq> can also print distinct
source IP and destination IP counts.  Users can define new key fields
and value fields using plug-ins written in C or PySiLK.

B<rwcount(1)> summarizes SiLK Flow records across time, producing
textual output with counts of bytes, packets, and flow records for
each time bin.

B<rwstats(1)> summarizes SiLK Flow records by a user-specified key
comprised of record attributes, computes values from the flow records
that match each key, sorts the results by the value to generate a
Top-N or Bottom-N list, and prints the results.  Users can define new
key fields and value fields using plug-ins written in C or PySiLK.

B<rwtotal(1)> summarizes SiLK Flow records by a specified key and
prints the sum of the byte, packet, and flow counts for flows matching
the key.

B<rwaddrcount(1)> summarizes SiLK flow records by the source or
destination IP and prints the byte, packet, and flow counts for each
IP.

I<IPset, Bag, and Prefix Map manipulation>

B<rwset(1)> reads SiLK Flow records and generates binary IPset file(s)
containing the source IP addresses or destination IP addresses seen on
the flow records.

B<rwsetbuild(1)> reads (textual) IP addresses in dotted-quad or CIDR
notation from an input file or from the standard input and writes a
binary IPset file.

B<rwsetcat(1)> prints the contents of a binary IPset file as text.
Additional information about the IPset file can be printed.

B<rwsettool(1)> performs union, intersection, difference, and sampling
functions on the input IPset files, generating a new IPset file.

B<rwsetmember(1)> determines whether the IP address specified on the
command line is contained in an IPset.

B<rwbag(1)> reads SiLK Flow records and builds binary Bag(s)
containing key-count pairs.  An example is a Bag containing the sum of
the byte counts for each source port seen on the flow records.

B<rwbagbuild(1)> creates a binary Bag file from a binary IPset file or
from a textual input file.

B<rwbagcat(1)> prints binary Bag files as text.

B<rwbagtool(1)> performs operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) on
binary Bag files and produces a new Bag file.

B<rwpmapbuild(1)> reads textual input and creates a binary prefix map
file for use with the Address Type (B<addrtype(3)>) and Prefix Map
(B<pmapfilter(3)>) utilities.

B<rwpmapcat(1)> prints information about a prefix map file as text.
By default, prints each IP range in the prefix map and its label.

B<rwpmaplookup(1)> finds information about specific IP address(es) or
protocol/port pair(s) in a binary prefix map file and prints the
result as text.

B<rwipaimport(1)> imports a SiLK IPset, Bag, or Prefix Map file into
the IP Address Association (IPA L<http://tools.netsa.cert.org/ipa/>)
library.

B<rwipaexport(1)> exports a set of IP addresses from the IP Address
Association (IPA) library to a SiLK IPset, Bag, or Prefix Map.

I<IP and port labeling files>

B<addrtype(3)>.  The Address Type file provides a way to map an IPv4
address to an integer denoting the IP as internal, external, or
non-routable.

B<ccfilter(3)>.  The Country Code file provides a mapping from an IPv4
address to two-letter, lowercase abbreviation of the country what that
IP address is located.  The abbreviations used by the Country Code
utility are those used by the Root-Zone Whois Index (see for example
L<http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm>).

B<pmapfilter(3)>.  Prefix map files provide a way to map field
values to string labels based on a user-defined map file.  The map
file is created by B<rwpmapbuild(1)>.

I<Run time plug-ins>

B<flowrate(3)>.  The flowrate plug-in, which must be loaded
explicitly, adds switches and fields to compute packets/second,
bytes/second, bytes/packet, payload-bytes, and payload-bytes/second.

B<int-ext-fields(3)>.  The internal/external plug-in makes available
fields containing internal and external IPs and ports (int-ip, ext-ip,
int-port, and ext-port).

B<ipafilter(3)>.  The IPA (IP Association) plug-in works with
B<rwfilter> to partition flows based on data in an IPA data store.
B<rwfilter> will automatically load this plug-in if it is available.
The plug-in requires that SiLK be compiled with IPA support
(L<http://tools.netsa.cert.org/ipa/>).

B<silk-plugin(3)> describes how to create and compile a new SiLK
plug-in using C.

I<Record grouping and masking>

B<rwgroup(1)> groups SiLK flow records by a user-specified key
comprised of record attributes, labels the records with a group ID
that is stored in the next-hop IP field, and writes the resulting
flows to the specified output path or to the standard output.
B<rwgroup> requires that its input is sorted.

B<rwmatch(1)> matches (mates) records as queries and responses and
marks mated records with an ID that is stored in the next-hop IP
field.  B<rwmatch> requires that its input is sorted.

B<rwnetmask(1)> reads SiLK Flow records, zeroes the least significant
bits of the source-, destination-, and/or next-hop-IP address(es), and
writes the resulting records to the named output path or to the
standard output.

I<Packet and external flow-format processing>

B<rwp2yaf2silk(1)> converts a packet capture (B<pcap(3)>) file---such
as a file produced by B<tcpdump(1)>---to a single file of SiLK Flow
records.  B<rwp2yaf2silk> assumes that the B<yaf(1)>
(L<http://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/>) and B<rwipfix2silk(1)> commands
are available on your system as it is a simple Perl wrapper around
those commands.

B<rwipfix2silk(1)> converts a stream of IPFIX (Internet Protocol Flow
Information eXport) records to the SiLK Flow record format.

B<rwsilk2ipfix(1)> converts a stream of SiLK Flow records to an IPFIX
(Internet Protocol Flow Information eXport) format.

B<rwpcut(1)> reads a packet capture file and print its contents in a
textual form similar to that produced by B<rwcut>.

B<rwpdedupe(1)> detects and eliminates duplicate records from multiple
packet capture input files.  See also B<rwdedupe(1)>.

B<rwpmatch(1)> filters a packet capture file by writing only
packets whose five-tuple and timestamp match corresponding records in
a SiLK Flow file.

B<rwptoflow(1)> reads a packet capture file and generates a SiLK Flow
record for every packet.

B<rwpdu2silk(1)> creates a stream of SiLK Flow records from a file
containing NetFlow v5 PDU records.

I<Scan detection>

B<rwscan(1)> attempts to detect scanning activity from SiLK Flow
records.  B<rwscan> can produce files that can be loaded into a
database and queried with B<rwscanquery>.

B<rwscanquery(1)> queries the scan database which has been populated
from database load files generated by B<rwscan>.

I<Flow utilities>

B<rwcat(1)> reads SiLK Flow records from the files named on the
command line, or from the standard input when no files are provided,
and writes the SiLK records to the specified output file or to the
standard output if it is not connected to a terminal.

B<rwappend(1)> appends the SiLK Flow records contained in the second
through final file name arguments to the records contained in the
first file name argument.

B<rwcombine(1)> reads SiLK Flow records from files named on the
command line or from the standard input.  For records where the
attributes field contains the I<flow timed-out> flag, B<rwcombine>
attempts to find the record with the corresponding I<continuation>
flag set and combine those records into a single flow.  B<rwcombine>
writes the results to the named output file or to the standard output.

B<rwcompare(1)> determines whether two SiLK Flow files contain the
same flow records.

B<rwdedupe(1)> reads SiLK Flow records from files named on the command
line or from the standard input and writes the records to the named
output path or to the standard output, removing any duplicate flow
records.  Note that rwdedupe will reorder the records as part of its
processing.

B<rwrandomizeip(1)> generates a new SiLK Flow file by substituting a
pseudo-random IP address for the source and destination IP addresses
in given input file.

B<rwrecgenerator(1)> generates SiLK Flow records using a pseudo-random
number generator; these records can be used to test SiLK applications.

B<rwsplit(1)> reads SiLK Flow records and generates a set of sub-files
from the input.  The sub-files can be limited by flow-, byte-, or
packet-counts, or by unique IP count.  In addition, the sub-file may
contain all the flows or only a sample of them.

B<rwswapbytes(1)> generates a new SiLK Flow file by changing the byte
order of the records in a given input SiLK Flow file.

I<Utilities>

B<rwfileinfo(1)> prints information (type, version, etc.) about a SiLK
Flow, IPset, Bag, or Prefix Map file.

B<rwsiteinfo(1)> prints information about the sensors, classes, and
types specified in the B<silk.conf(5)> file.

B<rwtuc(1)> generates SiLK flow records from textual input; the input
should be in a form similar to what B<rwcut(1)> generates.

B<rwfglob(1)> prints to the standard output the list of files that
B<rwfilter> would normally process for a given set of file selection
switches.

B<num2dot(1)> reads delimited text from the standard input, converts
integer values in the specified column(s) (default first column) to
dotted-decimal IP address, and prints the result to the standard
output.

B<rwgeoip2ccmap(1)> reads the MaxMind GeoIP database and creates the
country code mapping file that can be used by SiLK (see
B<ccfilter(3)>).

B<rwidsquery(1)> invokes B<rwfilter> to find flow records matching
Snort signatures.

B<rwresolve(1)> reads delimited text from the standard input, attempts
to resolve the IP addresses in the specified column(s) to host names,
and prints the result to the standard output.

B<silk_config(1)> prints information about how SiLK was compiled; this
information can be used to compile and link other files and programs
against the SiLK header files and libraries.

I<Deprecated tools>

B<mapsid(1)> maps between sensor names and sensor IDs using the values
specified in the B<silk.conf(5)> file.  B<mapsid> is deprecated as of
SiLK 3.0.0, and it will be removed in the SiLK 4.0 release.  This
functionality is available in B<rwsiteinfo(1)>.

B<rwguess(8)> reads a file containing NetFlow v5 PDU records and
prints the SNMP interfaces that are used most often and the number of
records seen for each interface.  B<rwguess> is deprecated as of SiLK
3.8.3, and it will be removed in the SiLK 4.0 release.  Similar
functionality is available using a combination of B<rwpdu2silk(1)>,
B<rwstats(1)>, and B<rwuniq(1)>.

B<rwip2cc(1)> maps a (textual) list of IP addresses to their country
code.  B<rwip2cc> is deprecated as of SiLK 3.0.0, and it will be
removed in the SiLK 4.0 release.  This functionality is available in
B<rwpmaplookup(1)>.

=head2 Packing system

The SiLK Packing System is comprised of daemon applications that
collect flow records (IPFIX flows from B<yaf(1)> or NetFlow v5 or v9
PDUs from a router), convert the records to the SiLK flow format,
categorize the flows as incoming or outgoing, and write the records to
their final destination in binary flat files for use by the analysis
suite.  Files are organized in a time-based directory hierarchy with
files covering each hour at the leaves.

The tools, configuration files, and plug-ins that comprise the SiLK
Packing System are:

B<flowcap(8)> listens to flow generators (devices which produce
network flow data) and stores the data in temporary files prior to
transferring the files to a remote machine for processing by
B<rwflowpack>.

B<rwflowpack(8)> reads flow data either directly from a flow generator
or from files generated by B<flowcap>, converts the data to the SiLK
flow record format, categorizes the flow records according to rules
loaded from a packing-logic plug-in, and writes the
records either to hourly flat-files organized in a time-based
directory structure or to files for transfer to a remote machine for
processing by B<rwflowappend>.

B<rwflowappend(8)> watches a directory for files containing small
numbers of SiLK flow records and appends those records to hourly files
organized in a time-based directory tree.

B<rwsender(8)> watches an incoming directory for files, moves the
files into a processing directory, and transfers the files to one or
more B<rwreceiver> processes.  Either B<rwsender> or B<rwreceiver> may
act as the server (i.e., listen for incoming network connections) with
the other acting as the client.

B<rwreceiver(8)> accepts files transferred from one or more
B<rwsender> processes and stores them in a destination directory.
Either B<rwsender> or B<rwreceiver> may act as the server with the
other acting as the client.

B<rwpollexec(8)> monitors a directory for incoming files and runs a
user-specified command on each file.

B<rwpackchecker(8)> reads SiLK Flow records and checks for unusual
patterns that may indicate data file corruption.

B<sensor.conf(5)> is a configuration file for sensors and probes used
by B<rwflowpack> and B<flowcap>.

B<packlogic-twoway(3)> is one of the plug-ins available that describe
a set of rules (the packing-logic) that B<rwflowpack> may use when
categorizing flow records as incoming or output.

B<packlogic-generic(3)> is one of the plug-ins available that describe
a set of rules (the packing-logic) that B<rwflowpack> may use when
categorizing flow records as incoming or output.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables affect the tools in the SiLK tool
suite.

=over 4

=item SILK_CONFIG_FILE

This environment variable contains the location of the site
configuration file, B<silk.conf(5)>.  This variable has precedence
over all methods of finding the site file except for the
B<--site-config-file> switch on an application.  For additional
locations where site configuration file may reside, see the L</FILES>
section.

=item SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR

This variable gives the root of directory tree where the data store of
SiLK Flow files is maintained, overriding the location that is
compiled into the tools (@SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR@).  The B<rwfilter(1)> and
B<rwfglob(1)> tools use this value when selecting which flow files to
process unless the user passes the B<--data-rootdir> switch to the
application.  In addition, the SiLK tools will search for the site
configuration file, F<silk.conf>, in this directory.

=item SILK_PATH

This environment variable gives the root of the directory tree where
the tools are installed.  As part of its search for configuration
files and plug-ins, a SiLK application may use this variable.  See the
L</FILES> section for details.

=item SILK_IPV6_POLICY

For tools that implement the B<--ipv6-policy> switch, this environment
variable is used as the value for that switch when it is not provided.

=item SILK_IP_FORMAT

For tools that implement the B<--ip-format> switch, this environment
variable is used as the value for that switch when it is not provided.
I<Since SiLK 3.11.0.>

=item SILK_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT

For tools that implement the B<--timestamp-format> switch, this
environment variable is used as the value for that switch when it is
not provided.  I<Since SiLK 3.11.0.>

=item SILK_IPSET_RECORD_VERSION

For the IPset family of tools, this environment variable is used as
the default value for the B<--record-version> switch when the switch
is not provided on the command line.

=item SILK_CLOBBER

The SiLK tools normally refuse to overwrite existing files.  Setting
SILK_CLOBBER to a non-empty value removes this restriction.

=item SILK_PAGER

When set to a non-empty string, most of the applications that produce
textual output (e.g., B<rwcut(1)>) will automatically invoke this
program to display their output a screen at a time.  If set to an
empty string, no paging of the output is performed.  The B<--pager>
switch on the application overrides this value.

=item PAGER

The applications that support paging their output will use the value
in this environment variable when SILK_PAGER is not set.

=item SILK_TMPDIR

This variable is used by tools that write temporary files (e.g.,
B<rwsort(1)>) as the directory in which to store those files.
SILK_TMPDIR overrides the value of TMPDIR.

=item TMPDIR

When set and SILK_TMPDIR is not set, temporary files are created in
this directory.

=item PYTHONPATH

The Python modules and library files required to use PySiLK from
B<rwfilter(1)>, B<rwcut(1)>, B<rwsort(1)>, and B<rwuniq(1)> as well as
from Python itself are installed under SiLK's installation tree by
default.  It may be necessary to set or modify the PYTHONPATH
environment variable so Python can find these files.  For information
on using the PySiLK module, see B<silkpython(3)> as well as the I<SiLK
in Python> handbook.

=item PYTHONVERBOSE

If the SiLK Python extension or plug-in fails to load, setting this
environment variable to a non-empty string may help you debug the
issue.

=item SILK_PYTHON_TRACEBACK

When set, Python plug-ins will output traceback information on Python
errors to the standard error.

=item SILK_RWFILTER_THREADS

The number of threads B<rwfilter> uses while reading input files or
files selected from the data store.

=item SILK_COUNTRY_CODES

This environment variable allows the user to specify the country code
mapping file that the SiLK tools use.  The value may be a complete
path or a file relative to SILK_PATH.  See the L</FILES> section for
standard locations of this file.

=item SILK_ADDRESS_TYPES

This environment variable allows the user to specify the address types
mapping file that the SiLK tools use.  The value may be a complete
path or a file relative to SILK_PATH.  See the L</FILES> section for
standard locations of this file.

=item RWRECEIVER_TLS_PASSWORD, RWSENDER_TLS_PASSWORD

Used by B<rwreceiver(8)> and B<rwsender(8)>, this variable specifies
the password to use to decrypt the PKCS#12 file specified in the
B<--tls-pkcs12> switch.

=item TZ

When a SiLK installation is built to use the local timezone (to
determine if this is the case, check the C<Timezone support> value in
the output from the B<--version> switch on most SiLK applications),
the value of the TZ environment variable determines the timezone in
which timestamps are displayed and parsed.  If the TZ environment
variable is not set, the default timezone is used.  Setting TZ to 0 or
to the empty string causes timestamps to be displayed in and parsed as
UTC.  The value of the TZ environment variable is ignored when the
SiLK installation uses utc.  For system information on the TZ
variable, see B<tzset(3)> or B<environ(7)>.

=item SILK_ICMP_SPORT_HANDLER

Modifies how "buggy" ICMP SiLK flow records are handled.  ICMP type
and code are normally encoded in the destination port field.  Prior to
SiLK 3.4.0, a bug existed when processing IPFIX bi-flow ICMP records
where the type and code of the second records were stored in the
source port.  SiLK 3.4.0 attempts to work-around this bad encoding by
modifying the buggy ICMP SiLK Flow records as they are initially read.
However, the change in SiLK 3.4.0 removes a previous work-around
designed to fix issues with SiLK Flow records collected prior to
SiLK 0.8.0 that originated as NetFlow v5 PDUs from some types of Cisco
routers.  The ICMP records from these Cisco routers encoded the type
and code in the source port, but the bytes were swapped from the
normal encoding.  When the SILK_ICMP_SPORT_HANDLER environment
variable is set to C<none>, all work-arounds for buggy ICMP records
are disabled and the source and destination ports remain unchanged.

=item SILK_LOGSTATS_RWFILTER

When set to a non-empty value, B<rwfilter(1)> will treat the value as
the path to a program to execute with information about this
B<rwfilter> invocation.  Its purpose is to provide the SiLK
administrator with information on how the SiLK tool set is being used.

=item SILK_LOGSTATS

This environment variable is currently an alias for
SILK_LOGSTATS_RWFILTER.  The ability to log invocations may be
extended to other SiLK tools in future releases.

=item SILK_LOGSTATS_DEBUG

If the environment variable is set to a non-empty value, B<rwfilter>
will print messages to the standard error about the SILK_LOGSTATS
value being used and either the reason why the value cannot be used or
the arguments to the external program being executed.

=item SILK_PLUGIN_DEBUG

When set to a non-empty value, an application that supports plug-ins
will print status messages to the standard error as it tries to open
each of its plug-ins.

=item SILK_TEMPFILE_DEBUG

When set to 1, the library that manages temporary files for
B<rwdedupe>, B<rwsort>, B<rwstats>, and B<rwuniq> prints debugging
messages to the standard error as it creates, re-opens, and removes
temporary files.

=item SILK_UNIQUE_DEBUG

When set to 1, the binning engine used by B<rwstats> and B<rwuniq>
prints debugging messages to the standard error.
