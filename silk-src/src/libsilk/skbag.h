**
**    The Bag API maps keys to counters.
**
**    For keys of 32-bits or less, the data structure is a tree whose
**    depth depends on the number of octets in the key.  A key's value
**    is encoded into the tree's structure.  At the leaves, the tree
**    contains blocks of counters to hold the counter associated with
**    a key.
**
**    The API defined in this file is current as of SiLK 3.0.
**
**    As of SiLK 3.0, some older functions and types have been
**    deprecated.  Those functions and types are declared in the
**    header file silk/bagtree.h.
