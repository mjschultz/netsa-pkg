"""
The netsa_silk module contains a shared API for working with common
Internet data in both netsa-python and PySiLK.  If netsa-python is
installed but PySiLK is not, the less efficient but more portable
pure-Python version of this functionality that is included in
netsa-python is used.  If PySiLK is installed, then the
high-performance C version of this functionality that is included in
PySiLK is used.
"""

# This module provides the symbols exported by PySiLK for the
# netsa_silk API.  It exists to rename PySiLK symbols that have a
# different name from the netsa_silk symbols, and to constrain the set
# of PySiLK symbols that are exported.  If a new symbol is added (to
# provide a new feature), it need only be added here and it will
# automatically be exported by netsa_silk.
