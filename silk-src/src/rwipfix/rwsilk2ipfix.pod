=head1 NAME

B<rwsilk2ipfix> - Convert SiLK Flow records to IPFIX records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  rwsilk2ipfix [--ipfix-output=FILE] [--print-statistics]
        [--site-config-file=FILENAME]
        {[--xargs] | [--xargs=FILENAME] | [FILE [FILE ...]]}

  rwsilk2ipfix --help

  rwsilk2ipfix --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rwsilk2ipfix> reads SiLK Flow records, converts the records to an
IPFIX (Internet Protocol Flow Information eXport) format, and writes
the IPFIX records to the path specified by B<--ipfix-output> or to the
standard output when stdout is not the terminal and B<--ipfix-output>
is not provided.

B<rwsilk2ipfix> reads SiLK Flow records from the files named on the
command line or from the standard input when no file names are
specified and B<--xargs> is not present.  To read the standard input
in addition to the named files, use C<-> or C<stdin> as a file name.
If an input file name ends in C<.gz>, the file will be uncompressed as
it is read.  When the B<--xargs> switch is provided, B<rwsilk2ipfix>
will read the names of the files to process from the named text file,
or from the standard input if no file name argument is provided to the
switch.  The input to B<--xargs> must contain one file name per line.

The IPFIX records generated by B<rwsilk2ipfix> will contain six
information elements that are in the Private Enterprise space for
CERT (the IPFIX Private Enterprise Number of CERT is 6871).  These six
information elements fall into two groups:

=over 4

=item *

Elements 30 and 31 contain the packing information that was determined
by B<rwflowpack(8)>, specifically the flowtype and the sensor.  These
values correspond to numbers specified in the B<silk.conf(5)> file.

=item *

Elements 14, 15, 32, and 33 contain information elements generated by
the B<yaf(1)> flow meter (L<http://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/>).  The
information elements will be present even if B<yaf> was not used to
generate the flow records, but their value will be empty or 0.

=back

For each of the six information elements that B<rwsilk2ipfix> will
produce, the following table lists its numeric ID, its length in
octets, its name, the field name it corresponds to on B<rwcut(1)>, and
a brief description.

The IPFIX template that B<rwsilk2ipfix> writes contains the following
information elements:

Note that the template contains both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  One set
of those addresses contains the IP addresses and the other set
contains only zeros.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique or is an
exact match for an option.  A parameter to an option may be specified
as B<--arg>=I<param> or B<--arg> I<param>, though the first form is
required for options that take optional parameters.

=over 4

=item B<--ipfix-output>=I<FILE>

Write the IPFIX records to I<FILE>, which must not exist.  If the
switch is not provided or if I<FILE> has the value C<stdout>, the
IPFIX flows are written to the standard output.

=item B<--print-statistics>

Print, to the standard error, the number of records that were written
to the IPFIX output file.

=item B<--site-config-file>=I<FILENAME>

Read the SiLK site configuration from the named file I<FILENAME>.
When this switch is not provided, B<rwsilk2ipfix> searches for the site
configuration file in the locations specified in the L</FILES>
section.

=item B<--xargs>

=item B<--xargs>=I<FILENAME>

Causes B<rwsilk2ipfix> to read file names from I<FILENAME> or from the
standard input if I<FILENAME> is not provided.  The input should have
one file name per line.  B<rwsilk2ipfix> will open each file in turn and
read records from it, as if the files had been listed on the command
line.

=item B<--help>

Print the available options and exit.

=item B<--version>

Print the version number and information about how SiLK was
configured, then exit the application.

=head1 EXAMPLES

In the following examples, the dollar sign (C<$>) represents the shell
prompt.  The text after the dollar sign represents the command line.

=for comment
Lines have been wrapped for improved readability, and the back slash
(C<\>) is used to indicate a wrapped line.

To convert the SiLK file F<silk.rw> into an IPFIX format and store the
results in F<ipfix.dat>:

 $ rwsilk2ipfix --ipfix-output=ipfix.dat silk.rw

To view the contents of F<ipfix.dat> using the B<yafscii(1)> tool (see
L<http://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/>):

 $ yafscii --in=ipfix.dat --out=-

Use the B<rwipfix2silk(1)> tool to convert the IPFIX file back into
SiLK Flow format:

 $ rwipfix2silk --silk-output=silk2.rw ipfix.dat

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item SILK_CLOBBER

The SiLK tools normally refuse to overwrite existing files.  Setting
SILK_CLOBBER to a non-empty value removes this restriction.

=item SILK_CONFIG_FILE

This environment variable is used as the value for the
B<--site-config-file> when that switch is not provided.

=item SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR

This environment variable specifies the root directory of data
repository.  As described in the L</FILES> section, B<rwsilk2ipfix> may
use this environment variable when searching for the SiLK site
configuration file.

=item SILK_PATH

This environment variable gives the root of the install tree.  When
searching for configuration files, B<rwsilk2ipfix> may use this
environment variable.  See the L</FILES> section for details.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<${SILK_CONFIG_FILE}>

=item F<${SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR}/silk.conf>

=item F<@SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR@/silk.conf>

=item F<${SILK_PATH}/share/silk.conf>

=item F<@prefix@/share/silk/silk.conf>

=item F<@prefix@/share/silk.conf>

Possible locations for the SiLK site configuration file which are
checked when the B<--site-config-file> switch is not provided.
