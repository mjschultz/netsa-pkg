/*
 *  ENABLING DEBUGGING
 *
 *    Setting the SENDRCV_DEBUG macro (below) to an bitmask of the
 *    following flags turns on specific types of debug output for
 *    rwsender/rwreceiver.  To see the messages in the running
 *    application, you MUST run with --log-level=debug.
 *
 *    The bit flags are:
 *
 *    0x0001 DEBUG_SKMSG_OTHER -- Logs messages for channel
 *    creation/destruction, network connection issues, and thread
 *    start/stop in skmsg.c.
 *
 *    0x0002 DEBUG_RWTRANSFER_PROTOCOL -- Logs messages regarding the
 *    higher-level protocol between rwsender and rwreceiver and thread
 *    start/stop in rwtransfer.c, rwsender.c, rwreceiver.c.
 *
 *    0x0004 DEBUG_RWTRANSFER_CONTENT -- Logs messages consisting of
 *    offset and length information for each message sent between the
 *    sender and receiver that is part of the actual file being
 *    transferred.  Generally used to debug file corruption.
 *
 *    0x0008 DEBUG_RWRECEIVER_DISKFREE -- Logs a message reporting
 *    disk usage each time rwreceiver asks about the amount of free
 *    space available on the disk.
 *
 *    0x0010 DEBUG_SKMSG_POLL_TIMEOUT -- Logs a message once a second
 *    when the call to poll() times out---this includes reading on the
 *    internal channel, which mostly waits for events.
 *
 *    The following are mostly used to debug lock-ups:
 *
 *    0x0100 DEBUG_SKMSG_MUTEX -- Logs a message for each mutex
 *    lock/unlock in skmsg.c
 *
 *    0x0200 DEBUG_RWTRANSFER_MUTEX -- Logs a message for each mutex
 *    lock/unlock in rwtransfer.c, rwsender.c, rwreceiver.c
 *
 *    0x0400 DEBUG_MULTIQUEUE_MUTEX -- Logs a message for each mutex
 *    lock/unlock in multiqueue.c
 *
 *    0x0800 DEBUG_INTDICT_MUTEX -- Logs a message for each mutex
 *    lock/unlock in intdict.c
 *
 *    0x1000 DEBUG_SKMSG_FN -- Logs a message for each function entry
 *    and function return in skmsg.c
 *
 *
