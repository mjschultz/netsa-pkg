=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rwtuc> reads text files that have a format similar to that produced
by B<rwcut(1)> and attempts to create a SiLK Flow record for each line
of input.

The fields which make up a single record should be separated by the
pipe character ('B<|>'); use the B<--column-separator> switch to
change this delimiter.  Note that the space character will not work as
delimiter since several fields (e.g., time, TCP-flags) may contain
embedded spaces.

The fields to be read from each line can be specified with the
B<--fields> switch; if the switch is not provided, B<rwtuc> treats the
first line as a title and attempts to determine the fields from the
title strings.

When B<--fields> is specified, B<rwtuc> still checks whether the first
line contains title strings, and B<rwtuc> skips the line if it
determines it does.  Specify the B<--no-titles> switch to force
B<rwtuc> to treat the first line as record values to be parsed.

Command line switches exist which force a field to have a fixed value.
These switches cause B<rwtuc> to override the value read from the
input file (if any) for those fields.  See the L</Fixed Values>
section below for details.

The textual input is read from the files named on the command line; if
no files are specified, B<rwtuc> attempts to read the text from the
standard input if it is not connected to a terminal.  To force
B<rwtuc> to read input from the terminal, specify C<stdin> or C<-> as
the input stream.

When the B<--output-path> switch is not provided, output is sent to
the standard output when it is not connected to a terminal.

By default, lines that cannot be parsed are silently ignored (unless
B<rwtuc> is attempting to determine the fields from the title line).
When the B<--verbose> switch is specified, problems parsing an input
line will be reported to the standard error, and B<rwtuc> will
continue to process the input.  The B<--stop-on-error> switch is
similar to the B<--verbose> switch, except processing stops after the
first error.  Input lines that cause parse errors can be copied to
another output stream with the B<--bad-input-lines> switch.  Each bad
line will have the source file name and line number prepended to it,
separated from each other and the source line by colons ('B<:>').

=head2 Field Constraints

Due to the way SiLK Flow records are stored, certain field
combinations cannot be supported, certain fields must appear together,
and some fields may only be used on certain occasions:

=over 4

=item *

Only two of the three time-related values (start time, duration, end
time) may be specified.  When all three are specified, the end time is
ignored.  This affects the C<sTime,9>, C<duration,10>, and C<eTime,11>
fields and the B<--stime>, B<--duration>, and B<--etime> switches.

=item *

Both ICMP type and ICMP code must be present when one is present.
These may be set by a combination of the C<iType> and C<iCode> fields
and the B<--icmp-type> and B<--icmp-code> switches.  These values are
ignored unless either the protocol is ICMP (1) or the record contains
IPv6 addresses and the protocol is ICMPv6 (58).  The ICMP type and
code are encoded in the destination port field (C<dPort,4> or
B<--dport>), and they overwrite the port value for ICMP and ICMPv6
flow records.

=item *

Both initial TCP flags and session TCP flags must be present when one
is present.  These may be set by a combination of the
C<initialFlags,26> and C<sessionFlags,27> fields and the
B<--flags-initial> and B<--flags-session> switches.  These fields are
set to 0 for non-TCP flow records.  When either field has a non-zero
value, any value in the (ALL) TCP flags field (C<flags,8> or
B<--flags-all>) is overwritten for TCP flow records.

=item *

If the B<silk.conf(5)> file defines more than one class, both class
and type must be present for the values to have any affect on the SiLK
flow record.  These may be set by a combination of the C<class> and
C<type> fields and the B<--class> and B<--type> switches.  If
F<silk.conf> defines a single class, that class is used by default.
The class and type must map to a valid pair; use B<rwsiteinfo
--fields=class,type> to see the list of valid class/type pairs for
your site.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

Option names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique or is an
exact match for an option.  A parameter to an option may be specified
as B<--arg>=I<param> or B<--arg> I<param>, though the first form is
required for options that take optional parameters.

=over 4

=item B<--fields>=I<FIELDS>

I<FIELDS> contains the list of fields (columns) to parse.  I<FIELDS>
is a comma separated list of field-names, field-integers, and ranges
of field-integers; a range is specified by separating the start and
end of the range with a hyphen (B<->).  Field-names are case
insensitive.

A field is ignored when the fixed value switch that corresponds to
that field is given on the command line (see L</Fixed Values>).

The field names and their descriptions are:

=over 4

=item ignore

a field that B<rwtuc> is to skip

=item sIP,1

source IP address in the canonical form: dotted-quad for IPv4 or
hex-encoded for IPv6 (when SiLK has been compiled with IPv6 support).
Integers from 0 to 4294967295 will be treated as an IPv4 address.

=item dIP,2

destination IP address in the same format as C<sIP,1>

=item sPort,3

source port as an integer from 0 to 65535 inclusive

=item dPort,4

destination port as an integer from 0 to 65535 inclusive (cf.
L</Field Constraints>)

=item protocol,5

IP protocol as an integer from 0 to 255 inclusive

=item packets,pkts,6

packet count as an integer from 1 to 4294967295 inclusive

=item bytes,7

byte count as an integer from 1 to 4294967295 inclusive

=item flags,8

bitwise OR of TCP flags over all packets; the string may contain C<F>,
C<S>, C<R>, C<P>, C<A>, C<U>, C<E>, C<C> in upper- or lowercase
(cf. L</Field Constraints>)

=item sTime,9

starting time of the flow, in the form
C<YYYY/MM/DD[:hh[:mm[:ss[.sss]]]]>.  A C<T> may be used in place of
C<:> to separate the day and hour fields.  A floating point value
between 536870912 and 4294967295 is also allowed and will be treated
as seconds since the UNIX epoch.

=item duration,10

duration of flow as a floating point value from 0.0 to 4294967.295

=item eTime,11

end time of flow in the same form as C<sTime,9> (cf.
L</Field Constraints>)

=item sensor,12

router sensor name or ID as given in F<silk.conf>

=item class

class of router at collection point as given in F<silk.conf> (cf.
L</Field Constraints>)

=item type

type of router at collection point as given in F<silk.conf>
(cf. L</Field Constraints>)

=back

Many of our packed files do not store the following fields and their
values will always be 0, but they are listed here for completeness:

=over 4

=item in,13

router SNMP input interface or vlanId if packing tools were configured
to capture it (see B<sensor.conf(5)>); an integer from 0 to 65535

=item out,14

router SNMP output interface or postVlanId; an integer from 0 to 65535

=item nhIP,15

router next hop IP address in the same format as C<sIP,1>

=back

SiLK can store flows generated by enhanced collection software that
provides more information than NetFlow v5.  These flows may support
some or all of these additional fields; for flows without this
additional information, the field's value is always 0.

=over 4

=item initialFlags,26

TCP flags on first packet in the flow; same form as the C<flags,8>
field (cf. L</Field Constraints>)

=item sessionFlags,27

bitwise OR of TCP flags over all packets except the first in the flow;
same form as the C<flags,8> field (cf. L</Field Constraints>)

=item attribute,28

flow attributes set by the flow generator:

=over 4

=item C<S>

all the packets in this flow record are exactly the same size

=item C<F>

flow generator saw additional packets in this flow following a packet
with a FIN flag (excluding ACK packets)

=item C<T>

flow generator prematurely created a record for a long-running
connection due to a timeout.  (When the flow generator B<yaf(1)> is
run with the B<--silk> switch, it will prematurely create a flow and
mark it with C<T> if the byte count of the flow cannot be stored in a
32-bit value.)

=item C<C>

flow generator created this flow as a continuation of long-running
connection, where the previous flow for this connection met a timeout
(or a byte threshold in the case of B<yaf>).

=back

Consider a long-running ssh session that exceeds the flow generator's
I<active> timeout.  (This is the active timeout since the flow
generator creates a flow for a connection that still has activity).
The flow generator will create multiple flow records for this ssh
session, each spanning some portion of the total session.  The first
flow record will be marked with a C<T> indicating that it hit the
timeout.  The second through next-to-last records will be marked with
C<TC> indicating that this flow both timed out and is a continuation
of a flow that timed out.  The final flow will be marked with a C<C>,
indicating that it was created as a continuation of an active flow.

=item application,29

guess as to the content of the flow, as an integer from 0 to 65535.  Some
software that generates flow records from packet data, such as B<yaf>,
will inspect the contents of the packets that make up a flow and use
traffic signatures to label the content of the flow.  SiLK calls this
label the I<application>; B<yaf> refers to it as the I<appLabel>.  The
application is the port number that is traditionally used for that
type of traffic (see the F</etc/services> file on most UNIX systems).
For example, traffic that the flow generator recognizes as FTP will
have a value of 21, even if that traffic is being routed through the
standard HTTP/web S<port (80)>.

=item iType

ICMP type as an integer from 0 to 255 inclusive (cf.
L</Field Constraints>)

=item iCode

ICMP code as an integer from 0 to 255 inclusive (cf.
L</Field Constraints>)

=back

Fields may not be specified more than once.

=item B<--column-separator>=I<CHAR>

Expect the character I<CHAR> to used as the delimiter between columns
instead of the default 'B<|>'.

=item B<--output-path>=I<FILEPATH>

Write the SiLK Flow records to I<FILEPATH>.  The strings C<stdout> and
C<stderr> may be used for the standard output and standard error,
respectively, as long as they are not connected to a terminal.

=item B<--bad-input-lines>=I<FILEPATH>

Copy any lines which could not be parsed to I<FILEPATH>.  The strings
C<stdout> and C<stderr> may be used for the standard output and
standard error, respectively.  Each bad line will be prepended by the
source input file, a colon, the line number, and a colon.  On exit,
B<rwtuc> will remove I<FILEPATH> if all input lines were successfully
parsed.

=item B<--verbose>

If an input line fails to parse, print a message describing the error
to the standard error, and continue to process the input.

=item B<--stop-on-error>

If an input line fails to parse, print a message describing the error
to the standard error and exit.  The output file will contain any
records successfully created prior to reading the bad input line.

=item B<--no-titles>

Treat the first line of input as record values to be parsed.  When
this switch is not provided, B<rwtuc> skips the first line of input if
it determines that the line contains the names of fields (titles).
B<rwtuc> exits with an error when B<--no-titles> is given but
B<--fields> is not.

=item B<--note-add>=I<TEXT>

Add the specified I<TEXT> to the header of the output file as an
annotation.  This switch may be repeated to add multiple annotations
to a file.  To view the annotations, use the B<rwfileinfo(1)> tool.

=item B<--note-file-add>=I<FILENAME>

Open I<FILENAME> and add the contents of that file to the header of
the output file as an annotation.    This switch may be repeated to
add multiple annotations.  Currently the application makes no effort
to ensure that I<FILENAME> contains text; be careful that you do not
attempt to add a SiLK data file as an annotation.

=item B<--compression-method>=I<COMP_METHOD>

Specify how to compress the output.  When this switch is not given,
output to the standard output or to named pipes is not compressed, and
output to files is compressed using the default chosen when SiLK was
compiled.  The valid values for I<COMP_METHOD> are determined by which
external libraries were found when SiLK was compiled.  To see the
available compression methods and the default method, use the
B<--help> or B<--version> switch.  SiLK can support the following
I<COMP_METHOD> values when the required libraries are available.

=over 4

=item none

Do not compress the output using an external library.

=item zlib

Use the B<zlib(3)> library for compressing the output, and always
compress the output regardless of the destination.  Using zlib
produces the smallest output files at the cost of speed.

=item lzo1x

Use the I<lzo1x> algorithm from the LZO real time compression library
for compression, and always compress the output regardless of the
destination.  This compression provides good compression with less
memory and CPU overhead.

=item best

Use lzo1x if available, otherwise use zlib.  Only compress the output
when writing to a file.

=back

=item B<--site-config-file>=I<FILENAME>

Read the SiLK site configuration from the named file I<FILENAME>.
When this switch is not provided, B<rwtuc> searches for the site
configuration file in the locations specified in the L</FILES>
section.

=item B<--help>

Print the available options and exit.

=item B<--version>

Print the version number and information about how SiLK was
configured, then exit the application.

=back

=head2 Fixed Values

The following switches can be used to set fields to fixed values.  A
value specified using one these switches overrides the field when it
appears in the input, causing that column of input to be completely
ignored.

=over 4

=head1 EXAMPLES

In the following examples, the dollar sign (C<$>) represents the shell
prompt.  The text after the dollar sign represents the command line.
Lines have been wrapped for improved readability, and the back slash
(C<\>) is used to indicate a wrapped line.

Using B<rwtuc> to parse the output of B<rwcut(1)> should produce the
same output:

 $ rwcut data.rw > cut.txt
 $ md5 < cut.txt
 7e3d693cd2cba2510803935274e1debd
 $ rwtuc < cut.txt | rwcut | md5
 7e3d693cd2cba2510803935274e1debd

To swap the source IP and port with the destination IP and port in
F<flows.rw> and save the result in F<reverse.rw>:

 $ rwcut --fields=dip,dport,sip,sport,5-15,20-29 flows.rw   \
   | rwtuc --fields=1-15,20-29 --output-path=reverse.rw

B<rwtuc> can be used to obfuscate the flow data in F<myflows.rw> to
produce F<obflows.rw>.  Pipe the output from B<rwcut> into a script
that manipulates the IP addresses, then pipe that into B<rwtuc>.
Using the B<sed(1)> script in F<priv.sed>, the invocation is:

 $ rwcut --fields=1-10,13-15,26-29 myflows.rw               \
   | sed -f priv.sed                                        \
   | rwtuc --sensor=1 > obflows.rw

If the first line of input appears to contain titles, B<rwtuc> will
ignore it.  In the first invocation below, B<rwtuc> treats C<SP> as an
abbreviation for C<sPort> and ignores the line.  Use the
B<--no-titles> switch to force B<rwtuc> to parse the line:

 $ echo 'SP' | rwtuc --fields=flags | rwcut --fields=flags
    flags|
 $
 $ echo 'SP' | rwtuc --fields=flags --no-titles | rwcut --fields=flags
    flags|
  S P    |
 $

By default, B<rwtuc> silently ignores lines that it cannot parse.  Use
the B<--verbose> flag to see error messages:

 $ echo sport | rwtuc --fields=flags --no-titles --verbose >/dev/null
 rwtuc: stdin:1: Invalid flags 'sport': Unexpected character 'o'


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item SILK_CLOBBER

The SiLK tools normally refuse to overwrite existing files.  Setting
SILK_CLOBBER to a non-empty value removes this restriction.

=item SILK_CONFIG_FILE

This environment variable is used as the value for the
B<--site-config-file> when that switch is not provided.

=item SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR

This environment variable specifies the root directory of data
repository.  As described in the L</FILES> section, B<rwtuc> may
use this environment variable when searching for the SiLK site
configuration file.

=item SILK_PATH

This environment variable gives the root of the install tree.  When
searching for configuration files, B<rwtuc> may use this environment
variable.  See the L</FILES> section for details.

=item TZ

When a SiLK installation is built to use the local timezone (to
determine if this is the case, check the C<Timezone support> value in
the output from B<rwtuc --version>), the value of the TZ environment
variable determines the timezone in which B<rwtuc> parses timestamps.
If the TZ environment variable is not set, the default timezone is
used.  Setting TZ to 0 or the empty string causes timestamps to be
parsed as UTC.  The value of the TZ environment variable is ignored
when the SiLK installation uses utc.  For system information on the TZ
variable, see B<tzset(3)> or B<environ(7)>.
